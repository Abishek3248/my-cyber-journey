# Bandit Wargame - OverTheWire

This folder contains my notes, solutions, and key takeaways from the **Bandit wargame** on OverTheWire, which focuses on practical Linux challenges.  

## Purpose
- Gain hands-on experience with Linux commands and system navigation through practical challenges.  
- Strengthen Linux command-line skills through problem-solving.  
- Learn file handling, permissions, processes, networking, and automation.  
- Build a strong foundation for cybersecurity and penetration testing.

> Note: Prior to Bandit, I explored Linux basics via tutorials and videos to become familiar with the environment.
