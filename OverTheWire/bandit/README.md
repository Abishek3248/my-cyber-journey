# Bandit Wargame - OverTheWire

This folder contains my notes from the **Bandit wargame** on OverTheWire, which focuses on practical Linux challenges.  

## Purpose
- Gain hands-on experience with Linux commands and system navigation through practical challenges.  

> Note: Prior to Bandit, I explored Linux basics via tutorials and videos to become familiar with the environment.
