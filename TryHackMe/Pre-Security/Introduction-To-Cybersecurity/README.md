# Intro to Cybersecurity

**What I learned and gained:**  
Through this module, I gained foundational knowledge of cybersecurity, including offensive and defensive security principles, hands-on experience with hacking and SOC simulations, and an understanding of different career paths in the field. I also learned practical tools, techniques, and how attackers and defenders operate.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
- **Offensive Security:** Ethical hacking, exploiting vulnerabilities, and testing systems using tools like Dirb.
- **Defensive Security:** SOC operations, threat intelligence, digital forensics, incident response, and malware analysis.
- **Practical Skills:**  
  - Exploiting web applications safely  
  - Using SIEM for monitoring and alert analysis  
  - Investigating suspicious IPs with tools like AbuseIPDB and Cisco Talos  
  - Reporting incidents and mitigating threats
- **Cybersecurity Careers:** The Careers room broadened my understanding of different cybersecurity roles, from analysts and engineers to penetration testers and red teamers, helping me align my learning path toward pentesting.

**Overall Takeaway:**  
This module laid the groundwork for hands-on and theoretical understanding of cybersecurity. It helped me differentiate offensive and defensive roles, explore tools and processes used in real-world scenarios, and broadened my perspective on career opportunities, especially toward my goal of becoming a penetration tester.
