# Careers in Cybersecurity

**What I learned and gained: After exploring this room, I gained a broader understanding of the different cybersecurity roles, including how penetration testing differs from red teaming, and I now have a clearer vision of possible career paths in the industry.

## Security Analyst
- Role: Maintains an organization’s data security.
- Responsibilities:
- Analyze cybersecurity across the organization with stakeholders.
- Compile reports documenting security issues and measures.
- Develop security plans based on new threats and trends.
- Learning Paths: Pre-Security → Cyber Security 101 → SOC Level 1

## Security Engineer
- Role: Designs, monitors, and maintains security controls, networks, and systems.
- Responsibilities:
- Test and implement security solutions based on threat intelligence.
- Monitor networks and mitigate vulnerabilities.
- Maintain systems for optimal security.
- Learning Paths: SOC Level 1 → JR Penetration Tester → Offensive Pentesting

## Incident Responder
- Role: Responds to and mitigates attacks while they unfold.
- Responsibilities:
- Develop and implement incident response plans.
- Maintain best security practices and post-incident reports
- Analyze incidents to improve future response strategies.
- Learning Paths: SOC Level 1
- 
## Digital Forensic Examiner
- Role: Investigates incidents and crimes using digital evidence.
- Responsibilities:
- Collect evidence following legal procedures.
- Analyze data to solve incidents or crimes.
- Document and report findings.

## Malware Analyst
- Role: Studies malicious software to understand its behavior.
- Responsibilities:
- Perform static analysis (reverse-engineering) of malware.
- Conduct dynamic analysis in controlled environments.
- Document and report findings.

## Penetration Tester (Pentester)
- Role: Tests systems and software for security vulnerabilities.
- Responsibilities:
- Conduct system, network, and web application tests
- -Perform security assessments and audits.
- Evaluate risks and recommend mitigations.
- Learning Paths: JR Penetration Tester → Offensive Pentesting
## Red Teamer
- Role: Simulates attacks to test an organization’s detection and response capabilities.
- Responsibilities:
- Emulate threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities while avoiding detection.
- Evaluate security controls, threat intelligence, and incident response.
- Report actionable insights to improve real-world defense.
- Learning Paths: JR Penetration Tester → Offensive Pentesting → Red Teamer

## Reflection:
- This room helped me understand the differences between roles like penetration testers and red teamers, and the breadth of careers available in cybersecurity. It broadened my perspective and clarified the skills and responsibilities required in different positions.
