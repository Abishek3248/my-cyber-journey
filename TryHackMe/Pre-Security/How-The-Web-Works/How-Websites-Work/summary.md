# Summary - How Websites Work

**This module introduced how websites are built and function, covering the relationship between frontend and backend components while highlighting common security issues. I strengthened my understanding of HTML, JavaScript, source code analysis, and injection vulnerabilities through practical labs.**

- Learned the distinction between frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) for structure and interactivity, and backend servers for processing requests and sending responses.
- Explored HTML basics, including the use of tags, attributes, and how missing elements (e.g., .jpg extensions) can break website functionality.
- Practiced JavaScript interactivity, dynamically updating page content and creating events such as button clicks.
- Understood sensitive data exposure, finding hardcoded credentials and hidden links in page source or frame source.
- Studied HTML Injection, where unsanitized user input is rendered directly on the page, allowing attackers to inject malicious HTML/JS.
- Reinforced the importance of input sanitization and secure coding practices to protect web applications.
- Practical labs helped visualize how even small mistakes in code or input handling can impact both usability and security.
