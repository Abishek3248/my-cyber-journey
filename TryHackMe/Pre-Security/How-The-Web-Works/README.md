# How the Web Works Module

## What I Learned and Gained
Through this module, I gained a solid understanding of how websites function, how web servers communicate, and the technologies and protocols that power the internet. I also learned about common web application vulnerabilities and gained practical experience in interacting with web servers, inspecting requests/responses, and working with both frontend and backend components.


## Key Concepts Covered
- **DNS (Domain Name System):** Learned how domain names are resolved to IP addresses, the domain hierarchy (root, TLD, subdomain), common record types (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT), the path of DNS queries through recursive, root, TLD, and authoritative servers, caching, and TTL values.
- **HTTP & HTTPS:** Understood the difference between HTTP and HTTPS, importance of encryption and server authentication, HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), status codes (2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx), request and response headers, URLs and their components, and the role of cookies in maintaining session state.
- **How Websites Work:** Explored frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) vs backend (server-side scripting) concepts, learned about static and dynamic content, sensitive data exposure, and HTML Injection vulnerabilities. Practiced identifying and fixing issues in HTML and JavaScript.
- **Putting It All Together:** Reviewed the full web request lifecycle from DNS resolution to web server response and rendering in the browser, explored load balancers, CDNs, databases, WAFs, and visualized the flow of static and dynamic content while understanding security mechanisms.


## Practical Skills
- Making and analyzing HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and responses.
- Inspecting request and response headers and cookies.
- Viewing page source and frame source to find sensitive data.
- Writing and manipulating HTML and JavaScript to create dynamic content and handle events.
- Understanding static vs dynamic content delivery and backend processing.
- Visualizing web infrastructure components including load balancers, CDNs, and WAFs.
- Recognizing and mitigating common web vulnerabilities like sensitive data exposure and HTML Injection.


## Overall Takeaway
This module strengthened my understanding of how the web works from both functional and security perspectives. By combining theoretical concepts with hands-on exercises, I learned the full lifecycle of a web request, how frontend and backend components interact, and how vulnerabilities can arise. It prepared me to analyze, secure, and optimize web applications effectively.
