# Summary â€“ HTTP in Detail

**This module explored the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and its secure variant HTTPS, covering how web browsers and servers communicate. I strengthened my understanding of web requests, responses, headers, status codes, URLs, cookies, and practical interaction with web servers.**

- Learned the difference between HTTP and HTTPS and the importance of encryption and server authentication.
- Explored HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and their roles in retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting resources.
- Studied HTTP status codes to interpret server responses, including success (2xx), redirection (3xx), client errors (4xx), and server errors (5xx).
- Examined request and response headers for conveying metadata between client and server.
- Understood URLs and their components: scheme, host, port, path, query, and fragment.
- Learned how cookies maintain session state, enable authentication, and are transmitted between client and server.
- Practiced making HTTP requests and inspecting responses, reinforcing the flow of information in web communication.
