# Summary â€“ Putting It All Together

**This module explored how all the components of the web interact, from DNS resolution to web servers, databases, CDNs, load balancers, and security mechanisms like WAFs. I strengthened my understanding of the full lifecycle of a web request, the interplay between frontend and backend, and practical web performance and security concepts.**

- Reviewed the end-to-end flow of a web request: resolving URLs via DNS, establishing connections, sending HTTP/HTTPS requests, and receiving responses.
- Explored how web servers serve static and dynamic content, handle multiple virtual hosts, and interact with backend databases.
- Learned how frontend renders pages, while backend scripting languages (PHP, Python, NodeJS, etc.) handle dynamic processing.
- Understood load balancers and CDNs for improving website performance and availability.
- Examined WAFs and other security mechanisms to protect web applications against attacks and misuse.
- Practiced visualizing the full web request lifecycle and identifying potential points for optimization or vulnerability.
