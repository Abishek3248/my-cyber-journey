# Summary â€“ DNS (Domain Name System)

**This module introduced the Domain Name System (DNS), highlighting its role in mapping human-readable domain names to IP addresses. It improved my understanding of how domains are structured, how queries are resolved, and how different record types support internet communication.**

- Learned how DNS replaces complex IPs with simple domain names.
- Explored the domain hierarchy: root, TLD, second-level domains, and subdomains.
- Understood common DNS record types (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT) and their use cases.
- Followed the journey of a DNS request through recursive, root, TLD, and authoritative servers.
- Learned about caching and TTL values for faster resolution.
- Practiced DNS lookups using tools like nslookup to query records directly.
