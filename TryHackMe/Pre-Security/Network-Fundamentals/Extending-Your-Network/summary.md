# Summary - Extending Your Network & Practical Labs

**This module strengthened my understanding of network security, device configuration, and real-world packet flow. I gained hands-on experience with firewall configuration, VPNs, and visual network simulators, reinforcing how network traffic is managed and secured.**

- Explored **port forwarding** to allow external access to network services.  
- Worked with **firewalls**, creating rules to block malicious traffic while allowing legitimate packets.  
- Learned **VPN basics**, creating secure tunnels for private network communication.  
- Explored **LAN networking devices**, including routers and switches.  
- Practiced using a **network simulator** to visualize TCP handshake, packet flow, and ARP resolution.  
- Reinforced the **layered structure of networks** and how protocols like ARP, TCP, and IP interact for reliable communication.
- Hands-on labs provided practical insights into network management, security, and traffic flow.
