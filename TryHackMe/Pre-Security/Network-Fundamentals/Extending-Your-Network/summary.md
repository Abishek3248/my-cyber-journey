# Summary - Extending Your Network & Practical Labs

**This module strengthened my understanding of network security, device configuration, and real-world packet flow. I gained hands-on experience with firewall configuration, VPNs, and visual network simulators, reinforcing how network traffic is managed and secured.**

- Learned **port forwarding** and how it allows devices and services to be accessed externally via specific public IPs and ports.
- Explored **firewalls** and their role in controlling incoming/outgoing traffic; practiced creating rules to block malicious packets using source/destination IPs and ports.
- Understood **firewall types**: 
  - **Stateful** – inspects entire connections and dynamically blocks bad traffic.
  - **Stateless** – inspects individual packets using static rules; simpler and less resource-intensive.
- Gained practical experience in a **firewall lab**, successfully blocking malicious traffic on port 80 while allowing legitimate traffic.
- Learned **VPN basics**, including creating secure tunnels over the Internet to connect separate networks, offering privacy, security, and anonymity.
- Explored **LAN networking devices**: 
  - **Routers** – route packets between networks using IPs; determine the optimal path based on shortest route, reliability, and medium speed.
  - **Switches** – connect multiple devices, forward frames using MAC addresses (Layer 2) or also route IP packets (Layer 3); VLANs allow logical segmentation.
- Practiced using a **network simulator** to understand the TCP handshake, packet flow, and ARP resolution from source to destination visually.
- Reinforced the **layered structure of networks** and how protocols at each layer (ARP, TCP, IP) interact to deliver reliable communication.
