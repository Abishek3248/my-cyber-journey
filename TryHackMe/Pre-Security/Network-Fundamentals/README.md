# Networking Fundamentals

## What I learned and gained:
- Through this module, I gained foundational knowledge of networking, including LAN design, device communication, data transmission, network security, and practical hands-on experience with tools and protocols used in real-world environments. I also developed an understanding of how networks operate, how devices interact, and how traffic is managed and secured.

## Key Concepts Covered:
- Networks and Connectivity: Understanding IP and MAC addresses, public vs private IPs, MAC spoofing, and basic network troubleshooting using ping, traceroute, and ICMP.
- LAN Fundamentals: Explored LANs, network topologies (bus, star, ring, mesh), switches, routers, subnetting, ARP, and DHCP for efficient local network management.
- OSI Model: Learned how the OSI model standardizes communication, the responsibilities of each layer (Physical â†’ Application), and data encapsulation across layers.
- Packets and Frames: Understood the difference between packets and frames, encapsulation, addressing, error checking, and how data is split and reconstructed during transmission.
- Extending Networks & Security: Explored port forwarding, firewalls (rule creation and packet filtering), VPNs for secure communication, LAN devices (routers and switches, Layer 2 & 3), and visualized TCP handshake, ARP, and packet flow using network simulators.

## Practical Skills:
- Configuring firewalls to block malicious traffic while allowing legitimate packets.
- Setting up and understanding port forwarding for external access.
- Using VPNs to securely connect remote networks.
- Visualizing packet flow and TCP handshakes through network simulators.
- Applying subnetting and VLANs for network segmentation and security.
- Using ARP to map IP addresses to MAC addresses for device communication.

## Overall Takeaway:
- This module laid a strong foundation in networking fundamentals, combining theoretical understanding with hands-on practice. It helped me understand how networks operate, how devices communicate, how data is transmitted and secured, and prepared me for more advanced cybersecurity and networking challenges.
