# Summary – OSI Model

**This module introduced the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, a foundational framework for understanding how data flows across networks. It strengthened my ability to analyze protocols, troubleshoot communication issues, and understand encapsulation across seven distinct layers.**

- Learned how the OSI model standardizes communication for interoperability between devices and vendors.
- Explored the seven layers (Physical → Application) and their unique responsibilities
- Understood how encapsulation passes data through each layer for structured transmission.
- Distinguished between hardware layers (Physical, Data Link, Network) and software/service layers (Transport, Session, Presentation, Application).
- Practiced applying OSI concepts through the OSI Dungeon Game, reinforcing hierarchy and sequencing.
