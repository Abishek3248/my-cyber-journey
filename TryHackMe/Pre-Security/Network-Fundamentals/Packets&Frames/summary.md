# Summary â€“ Packets and Frames

**This module introduced the concepts of packets and frames, explaining how data is divided and transmitted efficiently across networks. It strengthened my understanding of encapsulation, addressing, and data delivery in real-world networking.**

- Learned the difference between packets (Network Layer) and frames (Data Link Layer) and how they work together for structured data transmission.
- Understood how encapsulation adds headers and trailers to ensure proper routing, addressing, and error checking.
- Explored how data is split into smaller packets to prevent network bottlenecks and reconstructed at the destination.
- Reviewed key packet headers, including Time to Live (TTL), checksum, source/destination IP, and MAC addresses.
- Practiced visualizing how packets traverse the network and are encapsulated in frames, reinforcing the flow of data through network layers.
