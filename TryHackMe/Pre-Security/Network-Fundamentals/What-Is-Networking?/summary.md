# Summary - What is Networking

 **This room strengthened my foundation in networking, helping me understand device identification, connectivity, and the use of network troubleshooting tools essential for cybersecurity.**
 
- Understanding the concept of networks and the Internet.
- How devices are identified on a network using IP addresses (public vs private) and MAC addresses (including MAC spoofing).
- Practical exposure to connectivity testing using ICMP, ping, and traceroute.
- Hands-on experience applying these concepts to see how devices communicate and how network security can be circumvented (e.g., MAC spoofing to gain access).
- Awareness of network protocols and security implications of basic networking utilities.
