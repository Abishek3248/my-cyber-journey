# Pre-Security Path

## What I learned and gained:
- Through this path, I gained foundational knowledge in cybersecurity and networking, including understanding device communication, network structures, core security principles, and practical hands-on experience with tools, protocols, and labs. I also developed insights into how attackers and defenders operate, setting the groundwork for more advanced cybersecurity learning.

## Key Concepts Covered:
- **Cybersecurity Basics:** Understanding the differences between offensive and defensive security, ethical hacking, threat intelligence, incident response, and basic security operations.
- **Networking Fundamentals:** Learned about LANs, IP and MAC addressing, subnetting, switches, routers, DHCP, ARP, TCP/UDP protocols, OSI model layers, packets and frames, VLANs, port forwarding, firewalls, VPNs, and practical packet flow.

### Practical Hands-On Skills:
- Exploiting vulnerabilities safely in labs and exercises.
- Using network troubleshooting tools like ping, traceroute, and ICMP.
- Configuring firewalls to block malicious traffic and allow legitimate communication.
- Setting up VPNs and visualizing TCP handshakes, packet flows, and ARP resolution using network simulators.
- Applying subnetting and VLANs for network segmentation and security.
