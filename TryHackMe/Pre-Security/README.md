# Pre-Security Path

## What I learned and gained:
Through this path, I gained foundational knowledge in cybersecurity, networking, and web technologies, including understanding device communication, network structures, web protocols, and core security principles. I also developed insights into how attackers and defenders operate, setting the groundwork for more advanced cybersecurity learning.

## Key Concepts Covered:
- **Cybersecurity Basics:** Understanding the differences between offensive and defensive security, ethical hacking, threat intelligence, incident response, and basic security operations.
- **Networking Fundamentals:** Learned about LANs, IP and MAC addressing, subnetting, switches, routers, DHCP, ARP, TCP/UDP protocols, OSI model layers, packets and frames, VLANs, port forwarding, firewalls, VPNs, and practical packet flow.
- **Web Fundamentals:** Explored how websites work, including frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and backend (server-side scripting) components. Learned DNS resolution, HTTP/HTTPS communication, request/response headers, status codes, URLs, cookies, and web infrastructure components like load balancers, CDNs, databases, and WAFs. Also studied common web vulnerabilities like sensitive data exposure and HTML Injection.

## Practical Hands-On Skills:
- Exploiting vulnerabilities safely in labs and exercises.
- Using network troubleshooting tools like ping, traceroute, and ICMP.
- Configuring firewalls to block malicious traffic and allow legitimate communication.
- Setting up VPNs and visualizing TCP handshakes, packet flows, and ARP resolution using network simulators.
- Applying subnetting and VLANs for network segmentation and security.
- Making and analyzing HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and responses.
- Inspecting request and response headers and cookies.
- Viewing page source and frame source to find sensitive data.
- Writing and manipulating HTML and JavaScript to create dynamic content and handle events.
- Understanding static vs dynamic content delivery and backend processing.
- Visualizing web infrastructure components including load balancers, CDNs, and WAFs.
- Recognizing and mitigating common web vulnerabilities like sensitive data exposure and HTML Injection.

### Overall Takeaway:
This path laid a strong foundation in cybersecurity, networking, and web technologies, combining theoretical knowledge with hands-on exercises. I strengthened my understanding of how networks operate, how data is transmitted securely, how web servers and browsers communicate, and how web applications are structured and secured. The hands-on experience helped me see the full lifecycle of network and web interactions, prepared me for more advanced cybersecurity challenges, and built confidence in analyzing and securing digital systems.
