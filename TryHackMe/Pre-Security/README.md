# Pre-Security Path

## What I Learned and Gained
- Through this path, I gained foundational knowledge in cybersecurity, networking, web technologies, and Linux system administration. I built an understanding of how devices and networks communicate, how web servers and browsers interact, and how operating systems are managed. Alongside theoretical knowledge, I developed practical hands-on experience with tools, protocols, and real-world labs. This path also gave me insights into how attackers and defenders operate, setting the groundwork for more advanced cybersecurity learning.

## Key Concepts Covered
- **Cybersecurity Basics:** Differences between offensive and defensive security, ethical hacking, threat intelligence, incident response, and basic security operations.
- **Networking Fundamentals:** LANs, IP and MAC addressing, subnetting, switches, routers, DHCP, ARP, TCP/UDP protocols, OSI model layers, packets and frames, VLANs, port forwarding, firewalls, VPNs, and packet flow visualization.
- **Web Fundamentals:** How websites work, including frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and backend (server-side scripting) components. DNS resolution, HTTP/HTTPS communication, request/response headers, status codes, URLs, cookies, and web infrastructure components like load balancers, CDNs, databases, and WAFs. Common vulnerabilities such as sensitive data exposure and HTML Injection.
- **Linux Fundamentals:** Core Linux navigation commands (ls, cd, cat, pwd, find, grep), remote access via SSH, filesystem management, permissions, key directories, process monitoring (ps, top, signals), service management with systemctl, task automation with cron jobs, software management with APT, and system auditing with /var/log.

## Practical Hands-On Skills
- Exploiting vulnerabilities safely in labs and exercises.
- Using network troubleshooting tools like ping, traceroute, and ICMP.
- Configuring firewalls to block malicious traffic and allow legitimate communication.
- Setting up VPNs and visualizing TCP handshakes, packet flows, and ARP resolution using network simulators.
- Applying subnetting and VLANs for network segmentation and security.
- Making and analyzing HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and responses.
- Inspecting request and response headers and cookies.
- Viewing page source and frame source to find sensitive data.
- Writing and manipulating HTML and JavaScript to create dynamic content and handle events.
- Understanding static vs dynamic content delivery and backend processing.
- Visualizing web infrastructure components including load balancers, CDNs, and WAFs.
- Recognizing and mitigating common web vulnerabilities like sensitive data exposure and HTML Injection.
- Navigating Linux systems efficiently, managing files, editing with Nano/Vim, and transferring/serving files.
- Monitoring and controlling processes, configuring services, and automating tasks with cron.
- Installing and managing software securely with APT and auditing system logs for troubleshooting and security.

## Overall Takeaway
- This path laid a strong foundation in cybersecurity, networking, web technologies, and Linux system administration. It combined theoretical knowledge with hands-on exercises, allowing me to understand how networks operate, how data is transmitted securely, how web servers and browsers communicate, and how Linux systems are managed and secured. The hands-on experience strengthened my confidence in working with real-world tools and environments, prepared me for advanced cybersecurity challenges, and built a solid base for both penetration testing and defensive security practices.
