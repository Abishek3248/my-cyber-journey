# Regular Expressions Summary

**Focused on text pattern matching and manipulation to improve problem-solving, efficiency in text processing, and practical skills for CTFs and development tasks.**
 
- Learned to match specific characters and ranges using charsets; applied exclusions for precise pattern control.
- Used wildcards (.) for flexible matching and optional characters (?) to handle variable patterns.
- Applied metacharacters (\d, \w, \s, etc.) and repetitions (*, +, {m,n}) for efficient multi-character matching.
- Anchored patterns to start (^) or end ($) of lines for targeted searches.
- Created groups (()) and either/or patterns (|) for alternative matches and repeated sequences.
- Practiced building concise and efficient patterns to balance specificity with simplicity.
- Recognized the value of prebuilt expressions for common tasks (e.g., email matching) to save time and reduce errors.
