# Regular Expressions Summary

**Focused on text pattern matching and manipulation to improve problem-solving, efficiency in text processing, and practical skills for CTFs and development tasks.**
- Learned to match characters and ranges with charsets, including exclusions.
- Applied wildcards (.) and optional characters (?) for flexible patterns.
- Used metacharacters (\d, \w, \s, etc.) and repetitions (*, +, {m,n}) efficiently.
- Anchored patterns to line starts (^) and ends ($) for precise matching.
- Created groups (()) and either/or patterns (|) for alternatives and repetitions.
- Practiced concise, efficient regex patterns balancing specificity and simplicity.
- Leveraged prebuilt expressions for common tasks like emails to save time.
