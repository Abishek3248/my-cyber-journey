# Linux Fundamentals – Part 3 Summary 

**Part 3 focused on practical system administration and security tasks, building on foundational skills to handle real-world Linux management efficiently.**

- Created and edited files with Nano; explored Vim as an advanced editor.  
- Transferred and served files using `wget`, `scp`, and Python’s built-in `http.server`.  
- Monitored and controlled processes with `ps`, `ps aux`, `top`, and signals (`SIGTERM`, `SIGKILL`, `SIGSTOP`); practiced job control (`&`, `fg`).  
- Managed services with `systemctl`: start, stop, enable/disable applications, configure boot-time services.  
- Automated tasks using `cron` and `crontab` with scheduling syntax and wildcards.  
- Handled software management via APT: repositories, GPG key verification, package installation/removal.  
- Reviewed logs in `/var/log` for system monitoring, troubleshooting, and security auditing.
