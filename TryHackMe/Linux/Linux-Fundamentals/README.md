# Linux Fundamentals Notes

## What I Learned and Gained
- Through this module, I gained practical experience working with Linux systems, reinforcing my understanding of system administration, command-line operations, and essential tools used in cybersecurity. Across three parts, I built confidence in navigation, file management, process control, and system servicesâ€”forming a strong foundation for advanced tasks in penetration testing and defensive security.

## Key Concepts Covered

 - Part 1:
   - Core Linux commands: echo, whoami, ls, cd, cat, pwd.
   - File searching with find and grep.
   - Shell operators: &, &&, >, >>.

 - Part 2:
   - Remote access with SSH.
   - Command arguments with flags and man pages.
   - Filesystem interactions: create, move, copy, delete files and directories.
   - File permissions and user management.
   - Key Linux directories: /etc, /var, /root, /tmp.

 - Part 3:
   - File editing with Nano and Vim.
   - File transfer and hosting: wget, scp, python3 -m http.server.
   - Process monitoring and control: ps, top, signals (SIGTERM, SIGKILL, SIGSTOP), job control (&, fg).
   - Service management with systemctl.
   - Task automation using cron and crontab.
   - Software management with APT (repositories, GPG keys, install/remove).
   - System monitoring and auditing with logs in /var/log.

## Practical Skills
- Confidently navigating and managing the Linux filesystem.
- Searching and filtering files with powerful commands.
- Connecting to and managing remote systems via SSH.
- Editing and managing files with command-line editors.
- Transferring and serving files across systems.
- Monitoring, controlling, and managing system processes.
- Configuring services and automating tasks with cron jobs.
- Installing, updating, and removing packages securely with APT.
- Using system logs for troubleshooting and auditing.

## Overall Takeaway
- The Linux Fundamentals module provided hands-on, structured experience to build confidence and efficiency in using Linux for both administrative and cybersecurity purposes. By covering core commands, system management, file transfers, processes, and automation, it gave me the foundational skills required for real-world Linux environments and prepared me for advanced penetration testing and security challenges.
