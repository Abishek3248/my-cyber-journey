# Linux Notes

This folder contains my Linux-related notes from TryHackMe and practice labs.  
Topics include:

- Linux Fundamentals  
- Bash Scripting  
- Regular Expressions  

Each subfolder has concise notes, summaries, and cheatsheets for quick reference.  
These notes were created during my TryHackMe learning path, starting with Linux Fundamentals as a prerequisite for Bandit, and later expanding into scripting and regex for deeper proficiency.
