# Linux Notes

This folder contains my Linux-related notes from TryHackMe and other practice.  
It includes **Linux Fundamentals**, **Bash Scripting**, and **Regular Expressions**.  
Each subfolder has detailed notes, summaries, and cheatsheets.

## Modules
1. **Linux Fundamentals**
2. **Bash Scripting**
3. **Regular Expressions**
  
- These notes were completed during my TryHackMe learning path, starting with **Linux Fundamentals** as a prerequisite for Bandit, and later expanding into scripting and regex for deeper Linux proficiency.
