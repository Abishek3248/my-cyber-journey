# Summary â€“ Lay of the Land

**This room focused on post-exploitation enumeration after gaining initial access to a compromised machine, emphasizing how gathering detailed information about the environment supports lateral movement and privilege escalation.**

- Understanding the importance of enumerating **network infrastructure**, **Active Directory**, **users/groups**, **host defenses**, and **applications/services** after foothold.  
- Exploring **Active Directory enumeration** by identifying domains, forests, objects, domain controllers, users, and privileged groups.  
- Reviewing **user and group types** (local accounts, domain accounts, managed service accounts, administrators) and their role in privilege escalation.  
- Learning about **host-based security solutions** such as Antivirus, Windows Defender, Firewalls, Sysmon, HIDS/HIPS, and EDR, along with their detection techniques.  
- Exploring **network security solutions**, including firewalls, SIEM for centralized logging and alerts, and IDS/IPS for intrusion detection and prevention.  
- Enumerating **installed applications and services** to detect vulnerable software, misconfigured permissions, and custom internal services that may expose escalation paths.  
- Investigating **file and printer shares** as potential sources of sensitive information when misconfigured.  
- Reviewing **internal services** (DNS, web applications, file shares, databases) as valuable reconnaissance points for deeper environment understanding.
