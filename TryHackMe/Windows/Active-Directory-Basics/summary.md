## Summary â€“ Active Directory Basics

**This room focused on the fundamentals of Active Directory (AD), highlighting how it provides centralized management of users, computers, and resources within a Windows domain environment.**

- Understanding Windows Domains and the role of Domain Controllers in centralizing authentication and resource management.
- Exploring Organizational Units (OUs) as logical containers for structuring users, groups, and devices.
- Learning how to manage computers in AD by separating Workstations, Servers, and Domain Controllers.
- Reviewing authentication methods, including Kerberos as the default ticket-based protocol and NetNTLM as a legacy challenge-response system.
- Exploring Group Policy Objects (GPOs) for enforcing configurations and security baselines across OUs and domains.
- Understanding Trees as multiple domains sharing the same namespace, and Forests as a collection of trees with different namespaces.
- Learning about Trust Relationships (one-way and two-way) for enabling controlled resource access across domains.
