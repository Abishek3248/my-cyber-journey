Summary – Metasploit Meterpreter

**This module provided hands‑on experience with Meterpreter — Metasploit’s in‑memory post‑exploitation agent — teaching interactive control, enumeration, credential access, extension use, and post‑exploitation workflows.**

- Understood Meterpreter’s purpose and architecture: an in‑memory agent that minimizes disk artifacts and communicates over encrypted channels.  
- Learned Meterpreter command categories and how to list them with `help` (core, filesystem, networking, system, UI/media, elevation, credentials, scripting).  
- Practiced session management: listing sessions, interacting, backgrounding, migrating to other processes, and upgrading shells.  
- Explored filesystem and discovery commands for file access and searching (`ls`, `cd`, `download`, `upload`, `search`).  
- Used process and stability tools (`ps`, `getpid`, `migrate`) to improve session reliability and capture user activity.  
- Performed credential collection techniques (`hashdump`) and learned to load extensions (Kiwi/mimikatz) for advanced credential and Kerberos operations.  
- Learned to generate and deliver payloads with `msfvenom` and to catch callbacks using `exploit/multi/handler`.  
- Extended Meterpreter with scripting and tooling (`load python`, `python_execute`, `irb`, `load kiwi`) for automation and deeper post‑exploitation.  
- Practiced stealth vs detection tradeoffs: Meterpreter’s in‑memory design and TLS help evade basic detection, but modern AV/EDR can still detect activity.  
- Emphasized post‑exploitation goals: gather intel, escalate privileges, move laterally, persist, and extract sensitive artifacts.  
- Hands‑on: completed lab exercises — generated payloads, started handlers, obtained Meterpreter sessions, loaded extensions, dumped credentials, migrated processes, and searched for sensitive files.
