# Blue - Hands On Practice

## Recon

### Concepts learned
- How to scan a host for open ports and services.
- How to confirm an SMB-related vulnerability (MS17-010) from scan results.
- How to count open ports under a given port range and map those findings to likely services.

### Explanation
- I ran an initial full TCP port scan (all ports) then a focused service/version scan for ports under 1000 to quickly identify interesting services.
- SMB-related services (usually on 135/139/445) indicated the host is likely vulnerable to MS17-010; this can be confirmed with an NSE script or Metasploit SMB check/scanner.
- From the scan output the host had 3 open ports under 1000 (typical: 135, 139, 445) and is vulnerable to ms17-010.

### Notes
**Full port/service scan & import to Metasploit DB (recommended):**
db_nmap -sS -sV -p- <target-IP>
**Focused service/version scan for ports under 1000 (quick check):**
nmap -sS -sV -p1-1000 <target-IP>
**Check SMB MS17-010 with Nmap NSE:**
nmap -p 445 --script smb-vuln-ms17-010 <target-IP>
**Confirm with Metasploit scanner (alternative):**
msfconsole → use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010 → set RHOSTS <target-IP> → run
**Findings (from lab):**
Open ports under 1000: 3 (e.g., 135, 139, 445)
Vulnerability identified: ms17-010
