# Summary – Blue Room

**This room was a practical consolidation of the exploitation and post‑exploitation workflow using Metasploit, Meterpreter and offline cracking tools.**

- Performed end‑to‑end hands‑on exploitation: reconnaissance → exploit → upgrade → escalate → data collection.  
- Reconnaissance: ran full and focused scans (`db_nmap` / `nmap -p1-1000`) and identified 3 open ports under 1000 and MS17‑010 as the vulnerable vector.  
- Exploitation: used `exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`, set `RHOSTS`, explicitly chose a payload (`windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp`), and launched the exploit to obtain a shell.  
- Shell → Meterpreter: converted a plain shell to Meterpreter using `post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter` (set `SESSION`, `run`) to gain in‑memory agent capabilities.  
- Privilege escalation: ran `getsystem` and verified `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`; confirmed with `getuid` / `whoami` in a spawned shell.  
- Stability: enumerated processes (`ps`) and migrated Meterpreter into a SYSTEM‑owned long‑running process to improve session reliability.  
- Credential access: executed `hashdump` from an elevated Meterpreter session, saved the Jon hash, and cracked it offline (John → `alqfna22`).  
- Flag discovery: used `search -f` and targeted downloads to retrieve flags from system root, SAM area and administrator locations.  
- Tools & techniques practiced: `msfconsole`, `db_nmap`, `nmap NSE (smb-vuln-ms17-010)`, module workflow (`use` → `info` → `show options` → `set` → `run/exploit`), `post` modules, Meterpreter commands (`ps`, `migrate`, `hashdump`, `search`, `download`), and offline cracking with `john`.  
- Documentation & ethics: recorded workspace/module/options/payloads/session IDs and artifacts; all actions performed in an authorized lab environment.
