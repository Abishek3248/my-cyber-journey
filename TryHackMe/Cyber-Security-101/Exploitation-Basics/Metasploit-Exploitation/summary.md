- Gained knowledge of payloads and how to select compatible ones for exploits.
- Practiced running exploits, managing sessions, upgrading shells, and interacting with Meterpreter.
- Learned to use the Metasploit database for storing hosts, services, and scanning results.
- Explored workspace management and how to run scans with db_nmap and built-in auxiliary scanners.
- Understood how to generate custom payloads with msfvenom and deliver them using the handler.
- Practiced vulnerability scanning with auxiliary modules, such as VNC login brute-forcing.
