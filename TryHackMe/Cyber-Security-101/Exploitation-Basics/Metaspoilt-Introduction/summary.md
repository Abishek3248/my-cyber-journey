# Summary – Metasploit Introduction

**This module introduced the Metasploit Framework, its core components, and practical workflows for selecting and running modules during penetration tests.**

- Understood Metasploit’s editions and focus: Metasploit Pro (commercial, GUI) vs Metasploit Framework (open-source, CLI).
- Learned the main components: msfconsole (primary interface), modules (auxiliary, exploits, payloads, encoders, evasion, nops, post), and standalone tools (e.g., msfvenom, pattern_create, pattern_offset).
- Recognised payload types and delivery models: adapters, singles (inline), stagers and stages (staged vs inline affects size and delivery). Naming hint: underscores (_) often denote inline payloads; slashes (/) often denote staged payloads.
- Practiced inspecting module files and metadata under the framework modules directory to identify targets, required options, and platform compatibility.
- Mastered core msfconsole workflow: searching modules, entering module context with use, checking show options and show payloads, setting parameters (set, setg), and launching modules (run / exploit).
- Learned session and context management: module prompts, Meterpreter vs system shells, backgrounding sessions, and using sessions / sessions -i to manage active connections.
- Discovered practical considerations: start discovery with auxiliary modules, prefer inline payloads for quick tests and staged payloads for large implants or stealth, test encoders/evasion only in lab environments, and document module path, options, chosen payload, and observed behavior.
- Learned useful msfconsole commands and habits: info for module details, search with filters (type:, platform:, cve:), exploit -z to background sessions, and setg for persistent values across modules.
