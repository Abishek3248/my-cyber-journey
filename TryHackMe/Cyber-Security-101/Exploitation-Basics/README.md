# Exploitation Basics Module — README

## What I Learned and Gained
- Through this module I built a practical foundation in offensive security workflows for discovering, exploiting, and post-exploiting vulnerable systems. I learned both the conceptual foundations (attack surface discovery, exploit selection, payload models, and post-exploitation goals) and hands-on procedures for running, controlling, and documenting real exploits and agents (Metasploit, Meterpreter, scanning, and offline cracking) in an authorized lab environment.

## Key Concepts Covered
- Exploit lifecycle — reconnaissance → vulnerability identification → exploit selection → delivery → session management → post-exploitation → cleanup.
- Remote code execution & SMB abuse — understanding attack vectors like MS17-010 and crafted moniker (file://) abuse that can trigger network authentication (netNTLMv2 leakage).
- Exploit frameworks & modules — structure of Metasploit modules (exploits, payloads, auxiliaries, encoders, post), and module metadata/options.
- Payload models — singles/inline vs staged/stagers; tradeoffs in size, stealth, and delivery; common Meterpreter vs system shell distinctions.
- Session & agent architecture — Meterpreter’s in-memory design, extensions (Kiwi/mimikatz), process migration, session reliability and stealth vs detection tradeoffs.
- Post-exploitation goals and techniques — enumeration, credential extraction, privilege escalation, lateral movement concepts, and data exfiltration preparation.
- Detection, remediation, and ethics — scanning for exploit indicators (e.g., malicious monikers), patching, network controls (restrict SMB), lab safety and responsible handling of captured credentials/artifacts.

## Practical Skills

- Conducted robust reconnaissance using Nmap/db_nmap (port scans, service/version fingerprinting, NSE); identified vulnerable vectors (example: MS17-010).
- Interpreted and reproduced moniker link attack concept (file://...! monikers) to understand Protected View bypass and netNTLMv2 capture risks (theory + PoC workflow).
- Used Metasploit Framework end-to-end: searched and inspected modules, set options, chose compatible payloads, launched exploits, and documented module paths/options/payloads used.
- Generated and delivered payloads with msfvenom and handled callbacks with exploit/multi/handler; selected inline vs staged payloads based on objectives.
- Managed Meterpreter sessions: backgrounding, interacting, migrating processes, upgrading shells, loading extensions (Kiwi), and using built-in commands for enumeration and credential access (hashdump).
- Performed privilege escalation to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM (used getsystem and verified with getuid/whoami) and stabilized sessions by migrating into long-running SYSTEM processes.
- Extracted credential artifacts and performed offline cracking (saved hash, cracked offline with John) as part of post-exploitation data collection.
- Practiced complete lab workflow: craft delivery → deliver to target → ensure listener/handler → trigger exploit → capture session & artifacts → collect network/host/email evidence → document findings.
- Ensured ethical practice and documentation: recorded workspaces, module options, payloads, session IDs and artifacts; conducted all tasks only in authorized lab environments.
- Scanning & discovery: nmap (including NSE scripts), db_nmap (Metasploit DB integration) for focused and full port scans.
- Exploitation framework: msfconsole (search, use, info, show options, set, exploit/run, sessions), module inspection in the framework directory, msfvenom for payload generation.
- Post-exploitation agent: Meterpreter (core commands—filesystem, networking, system, process management), load kiwi / mimikatz workflows for credential harvesting.
- Handlers & delivery: exploit/multi/handler, handling staged vs inline payload callbacks, and session management techniques (backgrounding, sessions -i).
- Offline cracking & post tools: John the Ripper workflows (unshadow/format conversion → john → john --show) for cracking saved hashes.
- Auxiliary tooling & techniques: searchsploit/exploit-db lookups, NSE smb-vuln scripts (e.g., smb-vuln-ms17-010), process migration and persistence post modules, and typical Metasploit post modules (search, download, hashdump).
- Lab hygiene & documentation: workspace management, recording commands/options/payloads, and capturing mail/network/host artifacts for analysis.

## Overall Takeaway
- This module tied exploitation theory to applied offensive workflows: I can now discover and validate vulnerable vectors, choose and configure appropriate exploits and payloads, obtain and stabilize interactive sessions, and conduct principled post-exploitation (credential harvesting, escalation, evidence collection). I also learned the defensive and ethical side — how these attacks appear in logs, how to detect specific abuse patterns (e.g., file:// moniker abuse, outbound SMB authentication), and practical mitigations (patching, network controls, and strict lab/authorization discipline). These skills prepare me to perform controlled assessments and to recommend concrete hardening steps based on observed attacker techniques.
