# Summary â€“ SQL Fundamentals

**In this room, I explored the fundamentals of SQL and relational databases, focusing on how data is organized, manipulated, and queried efficiently.**

- Learned the basics of databases, including relational (SQL) vs non-relational (NoSQL) databases, and the structure of tables, rows, columns, and keys.
- Understood primary and foreign keys, and how they establish relationships between tables to ensure data integrity.
- Explored SQL as the language for interacting with relational databases, and the benefits of using SQL for querying, data manipulation, and analysis.
- Practiced database and table statements including CREATE DATABASE, USE, DROP DATABASE, CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, SHOW TABLES, DESCRIBE, and DROP TABLE.
- Mastered CRUD operations: INSERT to create records, SELECT to read data, UPDATE to modify existing data, and DELETE to remove records.
- Learned SQL clauses including DISTINCT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, and WHERE, and how they filter, group, and sort query results.
- Explored logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) and comparison operators (=, !=, <, >, <=, >=, BETWEEN, LIKE) to create precise queries.
- Practiced using string functions (CONCAT, GROUP_CONCAT, SUBSTRING, LENGTH) and aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, MAX, MIN) to manipulate and summarize data.
- Gained insight into efficiently querying databases, combining multiple functions and clauses, and ensuring accurate, structured, and optimized data retrieval.
