# Summary â€“ Web Application & HTTP Basics

**In this room, I explored the fundamentals of web applications and HTTP, focusing on how clients and servers communicate and how to secure these interactions.**

- Learned the components of a URL: scheme, user, host/domain, port, path, query string, and fragment, and how each affects navigation and security.
- Understood HTTP messages: requests and responses, with structure including start line, headers, empty line, and body.
- Studied HTTP request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, CONNECT) and the importance of sanitizing inputs and validating URL paths.
- Explored HTTP request headers and body formats, including URL Encoded, Form Data, JSON, and XML, and their implications for data handling and security.
- Examined HTTP response structure: status line, status codes, reason phrases, headers, and body, and how they inform clients about request outcomes.
- Learned about security headers such as Content-Security-Policy (CSP), Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS), X-Content-Type-Options, and Referrer-Policy, and how they mitigate attacks like XSS, clickjacking, and information leaks.
- Practiced making HTTP requests via GUI tools to perform GET, POST, and DELETE operations, observing headers, status codes, and response bodies.
- Gained insight into how proper request-response handling, input validation, and header configuration improve web application security.
