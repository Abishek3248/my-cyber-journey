# Summary â€“ JavaScript Essentials

**In this room, I explored the fundamentals of JavaScript, its execution in the browser, and best practices for secure coding.**

- Learned how JavaScript is executed directly in the browser without compilation, and how to run simple programs using `console.log()`.
- Understood variables (`let`, `const`), data types (strings, numbers, booleans), and functions for writing reusable code.
- Explored control flow with `if-else` statements, and practiced using `prompt()` for input and updating page content with `document.getElementById()`.
- Discovered how attackers can bypass client-side checks by modifying JavaScript in browser DevTools, highlighting the importance of server-side validation.
- Created and tested small programs in the Chrome Console, such as adding numbers and verifying age input.
- Learned about minification and obfuscation:
  - **Minification** reduces file size and improves performance.
  - **Obfuscation** makes code harder to read but still functional.
  - Practiced viewing, obfuscating, and deobfuscating JavaScript files in the browser.
- Studied security best practices:
  - Avoid relying solely on client-side validation.
  - Do not include untrusted libraries to prevent supply-chain attacks.
  - Never hardcode secrets (API keys, credentials) in code.
  - Always minify and obfuscate production code to improve performance and hinder reverse engineering.
- Gained insight into how JavaScript powers interactivity in web applications but must be written securely to reduce attack surface.
