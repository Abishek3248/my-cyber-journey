# Networking Module — README

## What I learned and gained
Through this module I built a practical, hands‑on foundation in networking: how devices communicate, how data is moved and secured, and how to inspect and troubleshoot networks. The course combined theory with lab exercises across seven focused rooms to prepare me for real‑world networking and cybersecurity tasks.

## Key Concepts Covered
- **Core Models & Encapsulation**
  - OSI and TCP/IP models, layer responsibilities, and how data is encapsulated and transported across networks.
- **Addressing & Routing**
  - IP addressing and subnetting, public vs private ranges, ARP (IP → MAC), routing basics, and how routers forward packets.
- **LAN Fundamentals**
  - Network topologies, switches vs routers, VLANs, DHCP (DORA), and local network behavior.
- **Transport & Sessions**
  - TCP vs UDP, connection-oriented vs connectionless communication, port numbers, and the TCP three‑way handshake.
- **Core Protocols**
  - WHOIS, DNS, HTTP/HTTPS, FTP/SFTP/FTPS, and email protocols (SMTP, POP3, IMAP) — how they operate and how TLS secures them.
- **Security & Encryption**
  - TLS/SSL for confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity; SSH for secure remote access; VPNs for tunneling and remote connectivity.
- **Traffic Capture & Analysis**
  - Packet capture and inspection with Wireshark and Tcpdump: capture, filtering, stream‑reconstruction, and interpreting packet metadata.
- **Active Reconnaissance**
  - Host discovery, port scanning, version/OS detection, timing, scripting, and output handling with Nmap.

## Practical Skills
- Performed host discovery and port/service enumeration on lab networks.  
- Used DHCP, ARP, ICMP (ping/traceroute) to observe address assignment and path discovery.  
- Captured and analyzed packet flows; followed TCP/HTTP streams and decrypted TLS for debugging (key‑logging lab).  
- Built and tested packet filters in Tcpdump and display/capture filters in Wireshark.  
- Tuned scans, interpreted scan output, and saved structured results for reporting.  
- Configured basic NAT and port‑forwarding scenarios; practiced firewall rule thinking and traffic filtering.  
- Practiced secure remote administration (SSH) and reviewed secure file transfer options (SFTP/FTPS).  

## Overall takeaway
This module delivered a compact, practical grounding in networking — from low‑level frames and ARP to application protocols and secure transports. The combination of conceptual clarity and extensive labs improved my ability to diagnose, monitor, and secure networked systems, and prepared me for deeper study or operational tasks in cybersecurity and network engineering.
