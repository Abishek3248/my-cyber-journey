# Summary â€“ Networking Secure Protocols

**This module strengthened my understanding of securing network traffic and gave practical insights into protecting communications over the Internet.**

- Learned about TLS as a cryptographic protocol providing confidentiality, integrity, and authentication for network communication.
- Understood how HTTP, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP are secured using TLS, becoming HTTPS, SMTPS, POP3S, and IMAPS.
- Explored secure remote access using SSH, including authentication, encryption, integrity, tunneling, and X11 forwarding.
- Learned about secure file transfer with SFTP (SSH-based) and FTPS (TLS-based), and the differences between them.
- Understood how VPNs create encrypted tunnels over the Internet, connecting remote users and offices while masking public IP addresses.
- Practiced hands-on with TLS decryption in Wireshark using browser TLS key logging, allowing visibility into otherwise encrypted traffic.
- Learned the practical implications of using TLS, SSH, and VPNs for securing different types of network traffic.
