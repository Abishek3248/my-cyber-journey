# Summary â€“ Networking Concepts

**This module strengthened my core networking fundamentals and provided practical insights into how networks function in real-world environments.**

- Understood the OSI and TCP/IP models, including the purpose and function of each layer.
- Learned the structure and purpose of IP addresses, subnetting, and the differences between public and private IP ranges.
- Gained knowledge of routing and how routers forward packets between networks.
- Explored transport layer protocols UDP and TCP, including connectionless vs connection-oriented communication and port numbers.
- Learned the concept of encapsulation and how data is packaged at each layer for transmission.
- Practiced using Telnet to connect to remote services and interact with network applications.
