# Summary â€“ Wireshark Basics

**This module strengthened my understanding of network traffic analysis and gave practical insights into capturing, inspecting, and filtering packets effectively.**

- Learned how Wireshark captures network traffic and displays it in three panes: packet list, packet details, and raw bytes.
- Understood packet dissection using OSI layers, including Frame, MAC, IP, Transport, Protocol, Application, and Application Data.
- Explored packet navigation features: Go to Packet, Find Packets, marking, commenting, exporting packets and objects, and adjusting time display formats.
- Learned to apply filters (capture and display) to focus on specific traffic, including Apply as Filter, Prepare as Filter, Conversation Filter, Colourise Conversation, Apply as Column, and Follow Stream.
- Understood packet colouring rules and how they highlight protocols or anomalies for easier analysis.
- Learned to follow TCP/UDP/HTTP streams to reconstruct application-level traffic and analyze client/server interactions.
- Practiced hands-on with PCAP files (Exercise.pcapng), dissecting packets, navigating captures, applying filters, marking/commenting packets, following streams, and exporting packets/objects.
- Gained practical insights into interpreting metadata, checking capture file properties, and understanding expert info to detect anomalies.
