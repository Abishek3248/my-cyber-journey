# Cheatsheet - Networking Essentials Quicklook

| Concept | Purpose / Function | Key Details | Commands / Notes |
|---------|------------------|------------|----------------|
| **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** | Automatically assigns network configuration to devices | Uses UDP (Server port 67, Client port 68); prevents IP conflicts; automates IP, subnet mask, gateway, DNS | **DORA Process:**<br>1. Discover: Client broadcasts seeking DHCP server<br>2. Offer: Server offers IP and config<br>3. Request: Client accepts offer<br>4. Acknowledge: Server confirms assignment<br>**Packet Example:** 192.168.66.133 assigned |
| **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** | Maps IP addresses to MAC addresses for local communication | Operates at layer 2 (data link); resolves MAC addresses for Ethernet/WiFi; uses broadcast for requests | **Packet Flow:**<br>1. ARP Request: Who has IP X? Tell MAC Y<br>2. ARP Reply: IP X is at MAC Z<br>**Command Example:** `arp -a`, `tcpdump -i <interface> arp` |
| **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)** | Network diagnostics & error reporting | Used for connectivity testing (`ping`) and route discovery (`traceroute`); Type 0 = Echo Reply, Type 8 = Echo Request, Type 11 = Time Exceeded | **Ping:** `ping <IP>` (-c 4 for 4 packets)<br>**Traceroute:** `traceroute <host>` (Linux/UNIX) / `tracert <host>` (Windows)<br>Shows RTT, hops, packet loss |
| **Routing** | Determines the best path for packets across networks | Routers maintain routing tables and select paths based on protocol metrics; multiple routing protocols exist | **Protocols:**<br>- OSPF: Open Shortest Path First, link-state<br>- EIGRP: Cisco proprietary, hybrid metric<br>- BGP: Internet backbone, inter-AS routing<br>- RIP: Simple hop-count based<br>Routing tables store network destinations and next hops |
| **NAT (Network Address Translation)** | Conserves IPv4 addresses; allows multiple devices to share one public IP | Translates private IPs to public IPs; router maintains translation table with IP:Port mapping | **Example:**<br>Internal: 192.168.0.129:15401 â†’ External: 212.3.4.5:19273<br>Supports private ranges (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16)<br>Enables multiple devices to access Internet via one public IP |
