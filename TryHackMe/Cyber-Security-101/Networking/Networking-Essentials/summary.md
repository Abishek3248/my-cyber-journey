# Summary â€“ Networking Essentials

**This room strengthened my understanding of core networking protocols and practical concepts that enable devices to communicate efficiently within and across networks. I learned both the theory and hands-on operations of key protocols that form the foundation of modern networking.**

- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):** Learned how devices automatically obtain IP addresses, subnet masks, gateways, and DNS settings using the DORA process (Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledge), preventing IP conflicts and simplifying network setup.
- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):** Understood how IP addresses are mapped to MAC addresses within a local network, enabling proper data link layer communication. Observed ARP requests and replies in packet captures.
- **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol):** Explored network diagnostics using `ping` and `traceroute`. Learned how ICMP reports connectivity status, measures round-trip time, and helps trace the route packets take across networks.
- **Routing:** Studied how routers determine the best paths for packets to reach their destination. Reviewed common routing protocols such as OSPF, EIGRP, BGP, and RIP, and learned the importance of routing tables for directing traffic.
- **NAT (Network Address Translation):** Learned how NAT allows multiple devices to share a single public IP address, conserving IPv4 addresses. Understood the translation process from private IPs to public IPs and how routers maintain the mapping tables for ongoing connections.
- Overall, this room provided a practical understanding of how devices communicate in a network, how IP addresses and MAC addresses interact, and how routing and translation protocols enable scalable and secure connectivity.
