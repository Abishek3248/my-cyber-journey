# Cybersecurity 101 Path

## What I Learned and Gained
- Through this path, I began building core cybersecurity skills starting with the Command Line module and then progressed to Networking fundamentals. I learned to interact with Linux shells and PowerShell, automate tasks with scripts, gather system and network information, and explore how devices communicate in a network — forming a practical base for further cybersecurity work. The Networking module added hands-on experience with protocols, traffic capture, and secure communication, enhancing my understanding of both local and remote network operations. Completing the Cryptography module further strengthened my skills by teaching me how to securely store and manage passwords, verify data integrity, understand cryptographic keys, and apply encryption concepts in practical cybersecurity tasks.

## Key Concepts Covered
- Command Line: Linux shell navigation, file operations, basic shell scripting (variables, loops, conditionals), searching with grep/find, PowerShell basics and pipelines, and remote command execution.
- Networking: OSI and TCP/IP models, IP addressing and subnetting, ARP, routing basics, DHCP, NAT, TCP/UDP communication, LAN devices, VLANs, and practical packet flow analysis. Learned how protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP operate and how TLS, SSH, and VPNs secure communications.
- Cryptography: Cryptography fundamentals (confidentiality, integrity, authenticity), symmetric and asymmetric encryption (AES, RSA, Diffie-Hellman), key management, SSH/GPG key workflows, password hashing (bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2, yescrypt), hash recognition and cracking (Hashcat, John the Ripper), data integrity verification (sha256sum), and HMACs for authenticity + integrity.

## Practical Hands-On Skills
- Navigating and managing files and directories in Linux and Windows.
- Writing and executing shell and PowerShell scripts for automation.
- Collecting system and network data (systeminfo, ipconfig, netstat, etc.).
- Filtering and processing command output (pipes, filters, selective properties).
- Executing commands on remote hosts and using CLI for troubleshooting.
- Performing host discovery and port scanning with Nmap.
- Capturing and analyzing network traffic with Wireshark and Tcpdump.
- Observing TCP/UDP streams, following sessions, and interpreting network metadata.
- Understanding and testing secure communication via TLS, SSH, and VPNs.
- Generating, managing, and using cryptographic keys (SSH/GPG).
- Recognizing, hashing, and cracking passwords using secure methods and tools.
- Verifying file integrity, using HMACs, and checking downloaded files against official hashes.

## Overall Takeaway
- The combination of Command Line, Networking, and Cryptography modules established a strong, practical foundation for cybersecurity tasks. I can now interact with systems, automate routine tasks, gather and analyze data, understand network behavior, secure communications, and apply cryptographic principles to protect data — skills I will continue to expand as I progress through the rest of the Cybersecurity 101 path.
