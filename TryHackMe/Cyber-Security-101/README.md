# Cybersecurity 101 Path

## What I Learned and Gained
- Through this path, I began building core cybersecurity skills starting with the Command Line module and then progressed to Networking fundamentals. I learned to interact with Linux shells and PowerShell, automate tasks with scripts, gather system and network information, and explore how devices communicate in a network — forming a practical base for further cybersecurity work. The Networking module added hands-on experience with protocols, traffic capture, and secure communication, enhancing my understanding of both local and remote network operations.

## Key Concepts Covered
- Command Line: Linux shell navigation, file operations, basic shell scripting (variables, loops, conditionals), searching with grep/find, PowerShell basics and pipelines, and remote command execution.
- Networking: OSI and TCP/IP models, IP addressing and subnetting, ARP, routing basics, DHCP, NAT, TCP/UDP communication, LAN devices, VLANs, and practical packet flow analysis. Learned how protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP operate and how TLS, SSH, and VPNs secure communications.

## Practical Hands-On Skills
- Navigating and managing files and directories in Linux and Windows.
- Writing and executing shell and PowerShell scripts for automation.
- Collecting system and network data (systeminfo, ipconfig, netstat, etc.).
- Filtering and processing command output (pipes, filters, selective properties).
- Executing commands on remote hosts and using CLI for troubleshooting.
- Performing host discovery and port scanning with Nmap.
- Capturing and analyzing network traffic with Wireshark and Tcpdump.
- Observing TCP/UDP streams, following sessions, and interpreting network metadata.
- Understanding and testing secure communication via TLS, SSH, and VPNs.

## Overall Takeaway
- The combination of Command Line and Networking modules established a strong, practical foundation for cybersecurity tasks. I can now interact with systems, automate routine tasks, gather and analyze data, understand network behavior, and monitor or secure communications — skills I will continue to expand as I progress through the rest of the Cybersecurity 101 path.
