# Cybersecurity 101 Path

## What I Learned and Gained
Through this path, I began building core cybersecurity skills starting with the Command Line module. I learned to interact with Linux shells and PowerShell, automate tasks with scripts, gather system and network information, and run commands on remote machines — forming a practical base for further cybersecurity work.

## Key Concepts Covered
**Command Line:** Linux shell navigation and file operations, basic shell scripting (variables, loops, conditionals), searching with `grep`/`find`, PowerShell basics and pipelines, and remote command execution.

## Practical Hands-On Skills
- Navigating and managing files and directories in Linux and Windows.  
- Writing and executing shell and PowerShell scripts for automation.  
- Collecting system and network data (`systeminfo`, `ipconfig`, `netstat`, etc.).  
- Filtering and processing command output (pipes, filters, selective properties).  
- Executing commands on remote hosts and using CLI for troubleshooting.

## Overall Takeaway
The Command Line module established a practical, command-driven foundation for cybersecurity tasks — automation, monitoring, and system interaction — which I will continue to expand as I complete additional modules.
