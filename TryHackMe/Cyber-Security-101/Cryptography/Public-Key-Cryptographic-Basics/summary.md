# Summary â€“ Public Key Cryptography Basics

**This room introduced the fundamentals of asymmetric cryptography, key exchange, and practical applications like SSH, digital signatures, and certificates.**

- Learned how asymmetric encryption is used to securely exchange symmetric keys, enabling fast and private communication.
- Explored RSA encryption, understanding the use of public and private keys and the mathematical basis of factoring large primes.
- Understood the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange for establishing a shared secret over an insecure channel.
- Learned the basics of SSH authentication: verifying server identity and authenticating clients with public/private key pairs.
- Explored digital signatures and certificates, ensuring message authenticity, integrity, and trust on networks.
