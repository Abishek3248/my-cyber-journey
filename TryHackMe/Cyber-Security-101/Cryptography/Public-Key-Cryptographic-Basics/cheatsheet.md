# Cheatsheet - Public Key Cryptographic Basics

| Concept                     | Key Points / Definition                                                                 |

| Cryptography                 | Practice of secure communication; ensures confidentiality, integrity, authenticity    |
| Plaintext                    | Original readable data                                                                 |
| Ciphertext                   | Encrypted unreadable data                                                              |
| Cipher                       | Algorithm to convert plaintext â†” ciphertext                                           |
| Key                          | Secret value used by cipher for encryption/decryption                                  |
| Encryption                   | Process of converting plaintext to ciphertext                                         |
| Decryption                   | Process of converting ciphertext back to plaintext                                     |
| Symmetric Encryption         | Same key for encryption & decryption; examples: AES, DES, 3DES                         |
| Asymmetric Encryption        | Public key encrypts, private key decrypts; examples: RSA, Diffie-Hellman, ECC         |
| RSA                          | Based on factoring large semiprimes; public key encrypts, private key decrypts         |
| Diffie-Hellman               | Establish shared secret over insecure channel for symmetric encryption                |
| XOR Operation                | Exclusive OR; reversible, associative, commutative; used in symmetric crypto          |
| Modulo Operation             | Returns remainder; important in asymmetric crypto calculations                         |
| Historical Ciphers           | Example: Caesar Cipher; simple shift cipher, insecure today                            |
| Key Exchange                 | Process to securely share symmetric keys using asymmetric cryptography                 |
| Public Key                   | Part of asymmetric crypto; shared openly                                              |
| Private Key                  | Part of asymmetric crypto; kept secret                                                 |
