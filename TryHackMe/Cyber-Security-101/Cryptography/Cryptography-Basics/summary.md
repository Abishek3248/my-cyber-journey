# Summary – Cryptography Basics

**This module introduced the fundamental concepts of cryptography, explained its importance, and provided an overview of basic encryption techniques and underlying mathematics.**

- Understood the importance of cryptography for ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity in digital communication.
- Learned the difference between plaintext (readable data) and ciphertext (scrambled data) and the role of ciphers in encryption and decryption.
- Explored historical ciphers like Caesar Cipher, Vigenère Cipher, Enigma, and one-time pad, and understood their strengths and weaknesses.
- Learned about symmetric encryption, which uses the same key for encryption and decryption (DES, 3DES, AES), and the challenges of secure key distribution.
- Learned about asymmetric encryption, which uses a public-private key pair (RSA, Diffie-Hellman, ECC) and its applications in secure communication.
- Explored basic cryptographic math, including XOR for reversible bitwise operations and modulo operation for handling large numbers in cryptography.
- Gained insights into how encryption and decryption work using keys, and how XOR can serve as a simple symmetric encryption method.
