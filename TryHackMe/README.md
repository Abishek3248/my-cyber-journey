# TryHackMe Labs

This repository contains my hands-on exercises and notes from TryHackMe (THM), covering Linux fundamentals, Bash scripting, and Regular Expressions. These modules strengthened my practical skills in system administration, command-line proficiency, and scripting for cybersecurity applications.


## Completed Modules
- **Linux Fundamentals** – Core Linux concepts, filesystem navigation, process and service management, and automation.  
- **Bash Scripting** – Writing scripts to automate tasks and enhance system management.
